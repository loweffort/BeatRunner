Hello, this is to create flying space junk in the background. 
It is very simplistic once you understand what is going on. 
I have included 3 types, crab, satellite and a ship. 

Troubleshootng:
I suggest you understand the X,Y,Z Axis as to manipulate the starting points and when it is to loop back.
I would play with the object by dragging them around and watch the coords change.
Remember the Coords in the script take priority over what you set in the game so 
feel free to mess with the unity coords as much as you like.
